# credit-risk-classification
In this challenge we were given a data on lending habits. This includes loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status.

Our job is to split the data into a training set and a testing set, then evaluate a the peer to peer lending data in a logistic regression model in order to assess the credit risk. 

We compile the results in our Credit Risk Analysis Report.
